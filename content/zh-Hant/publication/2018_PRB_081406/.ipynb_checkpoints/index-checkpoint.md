abstract: We theoretically introduce the fundamentally fastest induction of a significant population and valley polarization in a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide (i.e., MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$). This may be extended to other two-dimensional materials with the same symmetry. This valley polarization can be written and read out by a pulse consisting of just a single optical oscillation with a duration of a few femtoseconds and an amplitude of $\sim$0.25 V/Ã…. Under these conditions, we predict an effect of topological resonance, which is due to the Bloch motion of electrons in the reciprocal space where electron population textures are formed due to non-Abelian Berry curvature. The predicted phenomena can be applied for information storage and processing in PHz-band optoelectronics.
